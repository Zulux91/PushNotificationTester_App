## Privacy Policy

Bernd Bindreiter built the Push Notification Tester app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Bernd Bindreiter at no cost and is intended for use as is. 

**Information Collection and Use**

The app does not collect any user data or other information. The app does not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. The app only sends the Google Play Push Notification Registration Token to the server, which is being used to send the test notification to the client. The server does not store the token. After the notification has been sent, which usually takes around 1 second, the token is deleted from the memory (it was never stored and only kept in the memory).

**Crash Log Data**

Crash data generated on the client may include information such as your IP Adress, Phone Model, Operating System Version and crash log data (stacktrace). This information is automatically sent to the Google Play Developer Console. This data is anonymized before it is sent.
